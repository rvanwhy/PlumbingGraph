# PlumbingGraph

### What is PlumbingGraph?
A library for the combinatorial analysis of symplectic and contact plumbing graphs. Our current goal is to implement the full functionality of Contact Plumbing Calculus. Eventually all the functionality of [Neumann's Topological Plumbing Calculus (TPC)](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/neumann008.pdf) will also 
be implemented.

Small-scale conceptual cleanup is welcome! 

## Goals:

### Focus Goals
  - Implement Contact Plumbing Calculus (CPC)
  - The contact reduction algorithm of plumbing graphs

### Future Goals:
  - Graph construction functionality
  - Homology, Cohomology, and FundamentalGroup functors
  - Neumann's Reduction algorithm for topological plumbing graphs
  - Incorporate non-orientable nodes
  - Incorporate edge signs
  - Implement full Topological Plumbing Calculus (TPC)
